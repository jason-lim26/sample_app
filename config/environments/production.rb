  # After getting account activations working in development, we have to 
  # configure our application so that it can actually send email in production. 
  # We’ll first get set up with a free service to send email, and then configure
  # and deploy our application.
  #
  # To send email in production, we’ll use SendGrid, which is available as an 
  # add-on at Heroku for verified accounts. (This requires adding credit card 
  # information to your Heroku account, but there is no charge when verifying an 
  # account.) For our purposes, the “starter” tier (which as of this writing is 
  # limited to 400 emails a day but costs nothing) is the best fit. We can add 
  # it to our app as follows:
  #
  # $ heroku addons:create sendgrid:starter
  #
  # To configure our application to use SendGrid, we need to fill out the SMTP 
  # settings for our production environment. As shown in Listing 11.44, you will
  # also have to define a host variable with the address of your production
  # website. One trick for finding the host name of your Herouku app is to use 
  # the grep utility on the Git configuration file:
  #
  # $ grep heroku .git/config
  #
  # The final step is to use the username and password referenced in Listing 
  # 11.44 to create an API Key, which will allow the Heroku account we just 
  # created to send email in production. To get the necessary login credentials, 
  # we can use the config:get command at Heroku, as shown below:
  #
  # $ heroku config:get SENDGRID_USERNAME
  # <email username>
  # $ heroku config:get SENDGRID_PASSWORD
  # <SendGrid password>
